#Person or Pair 1: Create the first part of the code: read data in, create the additional variables required

#Person or Pair 2: Take the code from first person, perform the test of normality on the outcome and run the reg subsets command. 

#Person or Pair 3: Take the code from second person (which should already include person's 1), and output the plot that will help to determine #the best model among all best models (AIC vs p) plot. Determine which model is the best model. List the variables in this best model

#Person or Pair 4: Take the code from third person (which should already include person's 1, 2, and 3) and run the best model as a multiple #linear regression. Interpret the significant results. Use the plot command (see linear regression lecture if you have forgotten) to output #the fit statistics and comment on the first plot and the Q-Q plot.
